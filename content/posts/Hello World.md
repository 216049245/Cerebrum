Hello World! 

I've decided to create a separate blog purely to document my path as a developer. 

Hopefully a few people find it useful and tag along for the journey.

My end goal is to create something unique, not only in software development but this blog overall, as I become more skillful in writing and learning more about markdown/hugo I hope improve and learn more, 

I'll add a comment section in due time, things are just a little hectic at the moment with Uni (exams/assignments) and searching for intership opportunities.

That's all for now.
